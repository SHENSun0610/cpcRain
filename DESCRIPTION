Package: cpcRain
Title: Manage data from the CPC Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Global Daily Precipitation data set
Version: 2.0
Authors: Gopi Goteti (Version 1.0) and James Doss-Gollin (Version 2.0+)
Description: Data from the CPC server is excellent, but poorly organized and difficult to access. This package solves that by providing two ways to access this data. The first is through short queries which are saved to memory; the second is to download data (a year at a time) and put it in a ncdf4 file for efficient querying later. This option is for those who need regular access to the data. This package also provides functionality to turn 2D or 3D arrays (lon, lat, and time) of CPC data into tidy data.tables.
